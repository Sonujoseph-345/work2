                            <strong>Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio </strong> <a href="">(/diÀàk√¶prio ä/;</a>  Italian: <a href="">[diÀàkaÀêprjo];</a>  born November 11, 1974) is an American actor
                             and film producer. Knownfor his work as a <a href="">leading man</a>  in <a href="">biopics</a>  and <a href="">period films</a> , he is the recipient of <a href=""> numerous accolades</a>,

                            including an Academy Award, a <a href="">British Academy Film Award</a> , and three <a href="">Golden Globe Awards</a> . As of 2019, 
                            his films have grossed over $7.2 billion worldwide, and he has been placed eight times in annual rankings
                            of the world's highest-paid actors. <br><br>

                            Born in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career in the late 1980s by appearing in television commercials.
                            In the early 1990s, he had recurring roles in various television shows, such as the sitcom <a href="">Parenthood</a> , and 
                            had his first major film part as author <a href="">Tobias Wolff x</a> in <a href="">This Boy's Life</a>  (1993). At age 19, he received critical 
                     
                            acclaim and his first Academy Award and <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a>  nominations for his performance as a developmentally 
                            disabled boy in <a href="">What's Eating Gilbert Grape</a>  (1993). He achieved international stardom with the <a href="">star-crossed</a>  romances
                            <a href="">Romeo + Juliet</a>  (1996) and <a href="">Titanic</a>  (1997). After the latter became the <a href="">highest-grossing film</a> at the time, he reduced
                            his workload for a few years. In an attempt to shed his image of a romantic hero, DiCaprio sought roles in other
                            genres, including crime drama in <a href=""> Catch Me If You Can</a> (2002) and <a href=""> Gangs of New York</a> (2002); the latter marked 
                            first of his many successful collaborations with director <a href="">Martin Scorsese</a> . <br><br>
                    
                            DiCaprio portrayed Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and received acclaim for his performances in the
                    
                            political thriller <a href="">Blood Diamond</a>  (2006), the crime drama <a href=""> The Departed </a>(2006), and the romantic drama <a href="">Revolutionary Road</a> 
                            (2008). In the following decade, DiCaprio starred in several high-profile directors' projects, including the action 
                            thriller <a href="">Inception</a>  (2010), <a href="">the western Django Unchained</a>  (2012), the romantic drama The Great Gatsby (2013), the 
                            The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), the survival drama The Revenant (2015), for which he won an Academy Award and a <a href=""> BAFTA</a>
                            Award for Best Actor, and the comedy-drama <a href="">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a>  (2019), all of which were critical 
                            commercial successes.
                    
                            DiCaprio is the founder of <a href="">Appian Way Productions</a> , a production company that has produced some of his films and the
                            documentary series <a href="">Greensburg</a>  (2008‚Äì2010), and the <a href="">Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation</a> , a nonprofit organization devoted 
                            to promoting environmental awareness. He regularly supports charitable causes and has produced several 
                            on the environment. He currently serves as one of the <a href="">United Nations</a>  Messengers of Peace. In 2005, he was named a 
                            Commander of the <a href=""> Ordre des Arts et des Lettres</a> for his contributions to the arts, and in 2016, he appeared in 
                            Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. <br><br>
